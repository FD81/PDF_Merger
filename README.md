# PDF_Merger
A simple script to merge different PDF files into one, so that you do not have to resort to dodgy online merging systems or buy an Adobe Subscription to do this.
How to use it in Windows:
1. Download the merger.py file as a raw file and save it to a folder of your choice. 
2. In the same folder save all the PDF files you want to merge and rename the files from 1 onwards, this will be the order in which they are going to be merged.
3. Right click and open "Open in Terminal", you should see the terminal open at the same directory (something like C:#blah\blah\blah...) in which you saved your files and merger.py.
4. Type: "python merger.py" and press enter
5. You should see the message "PDF files merged successfully!"
6. Go back to your folder and find the file output.pdf where the merged files are contained. 
7. Remember to proceed with a new merger, delete the previous PDF files in the folder as well as output.pdf.
8. Remember, do not keep open the files that you are trying to merge while merging.
